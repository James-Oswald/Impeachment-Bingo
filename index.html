			Welcome to SA Impeachment Bingo! This site lets you generate and use bingo cards for the SA president's Impeachment trials.
			This will also be live-streamed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ualbanysenate/?hl=en">on Instagram @ualbanysenate</a>
			and the proceedings are open to the public. If you have any 
			ideas for squares on the card feel free to reach out to me on Discord @TenebrisLux#8353 
			in the <a href="https://discord.gg/EpNb4tx">SUNY Albany Discord Server</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Update: You can now get back your old card layouts by using seeds. Copy the seed of your old card into the text field and hit the button.
			Each seed coresponds to a unique card, so the structure of one card's seed will be preserved.
