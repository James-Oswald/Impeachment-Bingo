# Impeachment-Bingo
A comedic bingo web application for the 2020 UAlbany Student Association's Presidential Impeachment trial.

## Background
The President of the UAlbany student association was impeached for embezzling funds in February 2020. Before she was removed the UAlbany Senate decided to hold an Impeachment Trial. I stayed up an extra hour the night before the trial developing this application after getting requests and ideas from bingo spaces from friends. The game was designed to be played at the meetings of the UA Senate for the impeachment. About 40 people showed up to play and lots of people got bingo.
